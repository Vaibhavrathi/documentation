# View your usage and bill

When you are signed in with your Mapzen account, you can view your current usage and charges due.

If you need to update your credit card information to pay your bill, you can do that from your profile settings page. If you have questions about your bill or are having problems paying it, please contact Mapzen at (email@mapzen.com).

## View your usage

To check your usage, sign in to your developer account and review your dashboard.

You also receive [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) in the header for the server's response to your query.

1. Make sure you are signed into your Mapzen account.
2. Click your profile menu and click Dashboard. This page shows your current Mapzen API keys.
3. Click one of your API keys in the list and click Usage. The graphs show the number of requests on this key for each product.
(This UI will change if limits are per account and not per key)

## View your bill

Your bill is sent to the email address in your profile when due, and you can also review it when you are signed in to your Mapzen account. Your bill is in the United States Dollar (USD), and Mapzen handles the payment of sales or usage tax that may be required.

1. Make sure you are signed into your Mapzen account.

## Request a bill credit for service issues

While Mapzen hopes you never experience an outage or downtime in services, you can request a credit in the event that issues occur. See the developer agreement for more information about your rights and requirements, and keep in mind that those terms supersede any documentation content here.

1. If you believe that Mapzen has not met the uptime percentage in the developer agreement, record any information about the downtime you can, such as the service name and API, date and time, and estimated outage amount.
2. Within 15 days, send this to Mapzen support at (some support address @mapzen.com) for review.
