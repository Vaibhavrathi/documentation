# View your bill and current usage

When you are signed in with your Mapzen account, you can view your current usage and charges due.

Your bill is sent to the email address in your profile, and you can also review it when you are signed in to your Mapzen account.

Under Mapzen's pricing system, you pay only for what you use. You can think of your Mapzen bill as similar to a home utility bill, where your charges are dependent on how much water or electricity, for example, you consumed in a month.

Because there are no paid tiers, you pay for each individual API request you make. Although you may see pricing listed in units of 1,000, requests are not purchased in bundles. For example, $0.05 per 1,000 is intended to be a simpler way of representing that each request is $0.00005.

Billing is post-paid after the month ends, and there are no prepayment discounts available. There are no minimum fees for maintaining a Mapzen account, even if you have no usage for a while.

The billing currency is the United States Dollar (USD). Mapzen handles the payment of sales or usage tax that may be required in your area.

## Request a bill credit for service issues

While Mapzen hopes you never experience an outage or downtime in services, you can request a credit in the event that issues occur. See the developer agreement for more information about your rights and requirements, and keep in mind that those terms supersede any documentation content here.

1. If you believe that Mapzen has not met the uptime percentage in the developer agreement, record any information about the downtime you can, such as the service name and API, date and time, and estimated outage amount.
2. Within 15 days, send this to Mapzen support at (some support address @mapzen.com) for review.
