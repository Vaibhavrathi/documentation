# View your current usage and bill

_Note: The rate limit and pricing information presented here will be fully effective for all accounts starting June 1, 2017._

When you are signed in with your Mapzen account, you can view your current usage and charges due.

You can think of your Mapzen bill as similar to a home utility bill, where your charges are dependent on how much water or electricity, for example, you consumed in a month.

Because there are no paid tiers, you pay for each individual API request you make above the free rate limits. Although you may see pricing listed in units of 1,000, requests are not purchased in bundles. For example, $0.05 per 1,000 is intended to be a simpler way of representing that each request is $0.00005.

Billing is post-paid after the month ends, and there are no prepayment discounts available. There are no minimum fees for maintaining a Mapzen account, even if you have no usage for a while.

The billing currency is the United States Dollar (USD).

If you need to update your credit card information, you can do that from your [Mapzen account settings](account-settings.md#add-your-payment-method). If you have questions about your bill or are having problems paying it, please contact Mapzen at support@mapzen.com.

Rate limits are reset on the first day of every month at 00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

## View your usage

To check your usage, sign in to your developer account and review your dashboard.

1. Sign in to your Mapzen account.
2. In the top corner of the page, click `Account` and click `Dashboard`. This page shows your current Mapzen API keys.
3. Click one of your API keys in the list and click `Usage`. The graphs show the number of requests on this key for each product.

## Request a bill credit for service issues

_Note: This is only available to users who enable [premium support](account-settings.md#enable-premium-support), which includes a service-level agreement._

While Mapzen hopes you never experience an outage or downtime in services, you can request a credit in the event that issues occur. See the Mapzen [Terms of Service](https://mapzen.com/terms/) for more information about your rights and requirements, and keep in mind that those terms supersede any documentation content here.

1. If you have [premium support](account-settings.md#enable-premium-support) enabled on your account and believe that Mapzen has not met the uptime percentage in the terms of service, record any information about the downtime you can, such as the service name and API, date and time, and estimated outage amount.
2. Within 15 days, send this to [Mapzen support](mailto:hello@mapzen.com) for review.
