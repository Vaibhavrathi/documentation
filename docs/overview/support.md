### GitHub and community chat

If you are working with the code for Mapzen's open-source projects, you might be more comfortable communicating with through [GitHub](https://github.com). GitHub is the collaborative version control system Mapzen uses to manage code and documentation. Posting an issue lets engineers and other users know about a bug or software enhancement directly.

[Gitter](https://gitter.im) is an instant message chat system for GitHub users. Some of Mapzen's development teams have set up chat rooms associated with Mapzen's open-source projects so you can communicate with staff and the community in near real time.

- [Pelias](https://gitter.im/pelias/pelias) for geographic search and geocoding
- [Tangram](https://gitter.im/tangrams/tangram-chat) for the map-drawing engine
- [Tilezen](https://gitter.im/tilezen/tilezen-chat) for vector tiles and map data

If you have questions about running your own instance of Mapzen's open-source projects, GitHub and Gitter are your best options.

Another option for community chat is the #mapzen channel in [The Spatial Community](http://thespatialcommunity.org/), an online chat with thousands of geospatial enthusiasts as members.  

### Events at Mapzen offices

If you are near a Mapzen office in the New York or San Francisco area, Mapzen occasionally hosts community events. In addition, Mapzen regularly offers office hours, where you can get personalized technical assistance and training and meet other users.
