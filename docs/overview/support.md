# Get more help

Mapzen has many ways for you to get more help, and wants to hear from you. Send a note about questions about your bill, bugs or unexpected results, enhancement requests for future development, projects you have built with Mapzen, or any other questions you might have.

All Mapzen users have access to standard email support. Premium support with a service-level agreement is available for an additional monthly fee, and you can subscribe even if you are within the free rate limits of Mapzen’s products. Premium support users receive priority response times, usually within one business day.

The hours of operation for technical support are generally Monday through Friday, from 09:00 to 17:00, Pacific Time (US), excluding weekends and public holidays. Response through email currently the only support option available.

You can also get self-service help at any time at https://mapzen.com/documentation/ and https://mapzen.com/blog/.

Mapzen wants to make sure you never have to experience this. We offer many ways to learn more about our products and contact us&mdash;from self-service documentation to in-person technical assistance. We provide all these options at no cost to you.

## Documentation and blog posts
Your first resource for information about how to use Mapzen's products is the [technical documentation](https://mapzen.com/documentation/). Click the Documentation link at the top of any page on Mapzen's site to get to our help system. Documentation includes a variety of content, including comprehensive developer API reference, tutorials, glossaries, and conceptual overviews. If you want to help other users by making a correction or addition, each page has a button at the bottom (`Edit this page on GitHub`) that takes you to the source file.

We roll up our blog posts and other company news into a (mercifully short) monthly email newsletter. Sign up: https://mapzen.com/newsletter-signup/.


## Social media
We love hearing from you on our social media accounts. [Tweet us a hello](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@mapzen+hello+map+friends), whether you have questions about our APIs or showing off your work. Follow [@mapzen](https://twitter.com/mapzen) and you'll be the first to know about cool Mapzen things.

## GitHub and Gitter
If you are working with the code for Mapzen's open-source projects, you might be more comfortable communicating with us through [GitHub](https://github.com). GitHub is the collaborative version control system we use to manage our code and documentation. Posting an issue lets our engineers and other users know about a bug or software enhancement directly.

[Gitter](https://gitter.im) is an instant message chat system for GitHub users. Some of Mapzen's development teams have set up chat rooms associated with our open-source projects so you can communicate with us and the community in real time.

- [Pelias](https://gitter.im/pelias/pelias?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) for geographic search and geocoding
- [Tangram](https://gitter.im/tangrams/tangram-chat?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) for the map-drawing engine
- [Tilezen](https://gitter.im/tilezen/tilezen-chat?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) for vector tiles and map data

## In-person support during office hours
If you are in the San Francisco area, Mapzen hosts open office hours every third Wednesday of the month. During office hours, you can get personalized technical assistance and training and meet other users. We provide bagels and light breakfast snacks, and lovely views of the San Francisco Bay from our office windows, plus video conference links to our staff elsewhere. Last month, we had simultaneous video calls between attendees and our engineers in New York and London!
