Mapzen’s products help you put a map anywhere, search and route the planet, and try a world of open data. These are built from open-source tools that are packaged into a web service and hosted on Mapzen’s servers. To get started, you need to create a Mapzen developer account and API keys, and you are ready to build.

Follow these steps to get started.

## Sign up for a Mapzen account

1. Go to https://mapzen.com.
2. Click `Sign Up`.
3. Enter your e-mail address and password. Alternatively, if you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, you can use it to authenticate your Mapzen account. GitHub is a website that enables people to collaborate on a project.
4. Agree to the terms.
