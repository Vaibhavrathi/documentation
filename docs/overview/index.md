Mapzen’s products help you put a map anywhere, search and route the planet, and try a world of open data. These are built from open-source tools that are packaged into a web service and hosted on Mapzen’s servers.

To get started, you need to create a Mapzen developer account and API keys, and you are ready to build.

Mapzen Flex is Mapzen's pricing system, where you only pay for what you use. Follow these steps to get started developing on the Mapzen platform.

## Sign up for a Mapzen account

If you want to use Mapzen’s services, you need to create a Mapzen account. After you have an account, you can modify your account settings, view your usage, and manage your API keys.

1. Go to https://mapzen.com.
2. Click `Sign Up`.

## Add billing information

To use any of Mapzen’s services above the free limits, you need to add a payment method to your account. If you do not have a valid credit card on file and you reach the free limits, your maps may no longer function.

Optionally, take control of your bill by setting a monthly spending limit. This gives you the comfort of knowing that your bill will remain within the maximum amount you specify.

## Get an API key

An API key is a code that uniquely links API usage inside your application with your Mapzen account. You must include a Mapzen API key with all your server requests.

When signed in to your Mapzen account, you can access a dashboard that allows you to create, manage, and track the usage of your Mapzen API keys.
