Mapzen’s products help you put a map anywhere, search and route the planet, and try a world of open data. These are built from open-source tools that are packaged into a web service and hosted on Mapzen’s servers. To get started, you need to create a Mapzen developer account and API keys, and you are ready to build.

Mapzen Flex is Mapzen's pricing system, where you only pay for what you use. To use any of Mapzen’s services above the free limits, you need to add a payment method to your profile.
