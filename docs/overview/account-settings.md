## Change your email address or password

1. Make sure you are signed into your Mapzen account.

4. If you are using an email and password to sign in, you can update both of those.

## Add or update your credit card

To use any of Mapzen’s services above the free limits, you need to add a payment method to your profile, and be sure to keep the card updated if it expires or you are issued a new account number.

If you do not have a valid credit card on file and you reach the free limits, your access to that particular Mapzen service will cease for the remainder of the month.

At the end of each month, Mapzen calculates your usage and bill, and you charges are paid automatically by credit card.

2. Click your profile menu and click `Settings`.
3. Click `Add Payment Method`.
4. Enter your credit card information.

## Set monthly spending limits and alerts

With Mapzen Flex, you can set limits on your spending each month. This gives you the comfort of knowing that your bill always remains within a certain amount and you are avoiding unexpected charges. You can set separate limits for each Mapzen product, and turn on email notifications to alert you as you approach your maximums.

See https://mapzen.com/pricing for more information on current pricing and the limits available with the free plan.

If you reach your spending limit, your access to that particular Mapzen service will cease for the remainder of the month. Your account will not accumulate any charges for overages, but no results will be returned for your API requests. This means that your maps may no longer function.

Even if you reach a limit on one product, you can continue to use other Mapzen services up to your maximums, if you have set them. Rate limits are reset on the first day of each month at 00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

1. Make sure you are signed into your Mapzen account.
2. Click your profile menu and click `Settings`.
3. ? Turn on emails, set limits...
4. Set the limit $0 to ensure that your account does not accrue any costs at all.
