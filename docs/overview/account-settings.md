When you signed in on Mapzen’s website, you can view and modify your account settings.

## Sign in to your Mapzen account

Go to https://mapzen.com. 
Sign in either with your GitHub account authentication or by using your email address and password.
In the top corner of the page, click your profile button.
From this menu, you can modify your account settings.

## Change your email address or password

Make sure you are signed into your Mapzen account.
Click your profile menu and click Settings.
If you are using GitHub authentication, you can only change your email address. Note that this is the address that was part of your GitHub profile when you originally authenticated your Mapzen account.
If you are using an email and password to sign in, you can update both of those.

## Add or update your credit card

Your Mapzen Flex bill is paid automatically by credit card. If you want to use any of Mapzen’s services above the free limits, you need to add a payment method to your profile, and be sure to keep the card updated if it expires or you are issued a new account number. 

You are billed in the United States Dollar (USD).

Make sure you are signed into your Mapzen account.
Click your profile menu and click `Settings`.
Click `Add Payment Method`. 
Enter your credit card information.

## Set monthly cost limits and billing-related email alerts

With Mapzen Flex, you can set a budget to limit your costs in an month. This gives you the comfort of knowing that your bill always remains within a certain amount and you are avoiding unexpected charges. You can set separate limits for each Mapzen product, and turn on email notifications to alert you as you approach your budget cap.

See mapzen.com/pricing for more information on current pricing and the limits available with the free plan.

If you choose not to increase your budget limit or alter your usage, and you reach your monthly limits, your access to that particular Mapzen service will cease for the remainder of the month. Your account will not accumulate any charges for overages, but no results will be returned for your API requests. This means that your maps may no longer function. 

Even if you reach a limit on one product, you can continue to use other Mapzen services up to your budget caps, if you have set them. Rate limits are reset on the first day of each month at 00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

Set the limit $0 to ensure that your account does not accrue any costs at all.

## Request a bill credit for service issues

While Mapzen hopes you never experience an outage or downtime in services, you can request a credit in the event that issues occur. See the developer agreement for more information about your rights and requirements, and keep in mind that those terms supersede any documentation content here.

If you believe that Mapzen has not met the uptime percentage in the developer agreement, record any information about the downtime you can, such as the service name and API, date and time, and estimated outage amount.
Within 15 days, send this to Mapzen support at (some support address @mapzen.com) for review.
