## Set monthly spending limits and alerts

With Mapzen Flex, you can set a budget to limit your spending in an month. This gives you the comfort of knowing that your bill always remains within a certain amount and you are avoiding unexpected charges. You can set separate limits for each Mapzen product, and turn on email notifications to alert you as you approach your budget cap.

See mapzen.com/pricing for more information on current pricing and the limits available with the free plan.

If you choose not to alter your usage or increase your spending limit, and you reach it, your access to that particular Mapzen service will cease for the remainder of the month. Your account will not accumulate any charges for overages, but no results will be returned for your API requests. This means that your maps may no longer function.

Even if you reach a limit on one product, you can continue to use other Mapzen services up to your budget caps, if you have set them. Rate limits are reset on the first day of each month at 00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

1. Make sure you are signed into your Mapzen account.
2. Click your profile menu and click Settings.
3. ? Turn on emails, set limits...
4. Set the limit $0 to ensure that your account does not accrue any costs at all.
