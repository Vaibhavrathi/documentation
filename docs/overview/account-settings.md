# Update your Mapzen account settings

When you signed in on Mapzen’s website, you can view and modify your account settings. These include changing your email address and password, and updating your credit card and billing information.

## Sign up for a Mapzen account

1. Go to https://mapzen.com.
2. Click `Sign Up`.
3. Choose your authentication method. Create your account by entering your e-mail address and password, or if you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, you can use it for authentication. GitHub is a website that enables people to collaborate on a project.
4. Agree to the terms.

In the future when you sign in, use either your email address and password or GitHub account, depending on how you registered originally. If you forgot your password, you can also attempt to reset it.

To delete your account, you need to [contact Mapzen](mailto:support@mapzen.com). If you are using GitHub, sign into your GitHub account and revoke [Mapzen Platform](https://help.github.com/articles/reviewing-your-authorized-applications-oauth/) as an authorized application.

## Change your email address or password

1. Sign in to your Mapzen account.
2. In the top corner of the page, click `Account` and click `Settings`.
3. If you are using an email address to sign in, you can update your email address and password.
4. With GitHub authentication, you can change your email address where you receive communications from Mapzen. Note that this is the address that was part of your GitHub profile when you originally authenticated your Mapzen account.

## Add your Mapzen Flex payment method

To use any of Mapzen’s services above the free limits, you need to add a payment method to your account. Be sure to keep your credit card information updated if it expires or you are issued a new number.

If you do not have a valid credit card on file and you reach the free limits, your access to that Mapzen service will cease for the remainder of the month. You can continue to use other services up to their individual free limits.

At the end of each month, Mapzen calculates your usage and bill, and your charges are paid automatically by the credit card on file.

1. Sign in to your Mapzen account.
2. In the top corner of the page, click `Account` and click `Settings`.
3. In the `Billing` section, `Add Payment Method`.
4. Enter your credit card information.

If your account has any pending usage charges in a month, you can update it to a different credit card, but are unable to delete your credit card altogether until the balance has cleared.

## Set monthly spending limits

With Mapzen Flex, you can set limits on your spending each month. This gives you the comfort of knowing that your bill will remain within the maximum amount you specify.

To set a spending limit, you first need to add a payment method to your account. By default, there is no spending limit on your account, which means your usage (and potential bill) is unrestricted. You are notified by email as you approach your spending limit.

The spending limit applies across all services. If you reach your spending limit by using only Mapzen Search, for example, you will not be able to use Mapzen Search or any other services beyond the free limits for the remainder of the month. Your account will not accumulate any charges for overages, but no results will be returned for your API requests. This means that your maps may no longer function.

Rate limits are reset on the first day of every month at 00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

See https://mapzen.com/pricing for more information on current pricing and the limits available with the free plan.

1. Sign in to your Mapzen account.
2. In the top corner of the page, click `Account` and click `Settings`.
3. Make sure you have a payment method on your account. You will not see additional billing information unless you have a credit card on file.
4. In the `Billing` section, click `Update` under `Monthly spending limit`.
5. Make sure your billing status is `Enabled`.
6. Enter the maximum you want to spend across all Mapzen services.

As you approach your spending limit, your choices are to increase your spending limits, adjust your usage, or accept that your access to paid services will end.

## Set your billing status

When billing is enabled, you have access to Mapzen services at levels above the free limits and are agreeing to pay for your usage, up to your monthly spending limit, if one exists. By default, billing is enabled when you add a payment method to your account.

To stop billing, set your billing status to disabled in the `Billing` section of your account settings. This has the effect of setting your monthly spending limit to $0 because you are only able to use Mapzen services up to the free limits of each product. If you exhaust the free limits, your maps may no longer function.

Any charges that were pending before you disabled billing will still be charged to the credit card on file at the end of the current billing cycle. However, no further charges can accrue. The billing status remains as you set it until you change it in the future.

Anytime you want to start billing again, set your billing status to `Enabled`.
