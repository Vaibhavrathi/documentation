# Update your Mapzen account settings

When you signed in on Mapzen’s website, you can view and modify your account settings. These include changing your email address and password, and updating your credit card and billing information.

## Sign in to your Mapzen account

1. Go to https://mapzen.com.
2. Sign in with your email address and password. Alternatively, authenticate with your GitHub account.
3. In the top corner of the page, click `Account`.
4. From this menu, you can modify your settings.

## Change your email address or password

1. Sign in to your Mapzen account.
2. In the top corner of the page, click `Account` and click `Settings`.
3. If you are using GitHub authentication, you can only change your email address. Note that this is the address that was part of your GitHub profile when you originally authenticated your Mapzen account.
4. If you are using an email and password to sign in, you can update both of those.

## Add or update your Mapzen Flex payment method

To use any of Mapzen’s services above the free limits, you need to add a credit card to your account. Be sure to keep your card information updated if it expires or you are issued a new number.

If you do not have a valid credit card on file and you reach the free limits, your access to that Mapzen service will cease for the remainder of the month. You can continue to use other services up to their individual free limits.

At the end of each month, Mapzen calculates your usage and bill, and your charges are paid automatically by credit card.

1. Sign in to your Mapzen account.
2. In the top corner of the page, click `Account` and click `Settings`.
3. Click `Add Payment Method`.
4. Enter your credit card information.

If your account has any pending usage charges in a month, you can update your payment method information, but are unable to remove a credit card altogether until the balance is cleared.

## Set monthly spending limits

With Mapzen Flex, you can set limits on your spending each month. This gives you the comfort of knowing that your bill will remain within the maximum amount you specify.

To set a spending limit, you first need to add a payment method to your account. By default, there is no spending limit on your account, which means your usage (and potential bill) is unrestricted. You are notified by email as you approach your spending limit.

The spending limit applies across all services. If you reach your spending limit by using only Mapzen Search, for example, you will not be able to use Mapzen Search or any other services above the free limits for the remainder of the month. Your account will not accumulate any charges for overages, but no results will be returned for your API requests. This means that your maps may no longer function.

Rate limits are reset on the first day of each month at 00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

See https://mapzen.com/pricing for more information on current pricing and the limits available with the free plan.

1. Sign in to your Mapzen account.
2. In the top corner of the page, click `Account` and click `Settings`.
3. Make sure you have a payment method on your account. You will not see additional billing information until you have a credit card on file.
4. Under `Billing`, click `Update`.
5. Make sure your billing status is active.
6. Enter the maximum you want to spend for all Mapzen services.

As you approach your spending limits, your choices are to adjust your usage, accept that your access to paid services will end, or increase your limits.

## Deactivate access to Mapzen Flex billing

If you want to disable Mapzen Flex on your account and stop billing, set your billing status to inactive. Do this by clicking `Billing` and `Update`. ????

Deactivating your billing ends your paid usage, and makes it so you are only able to use Mapzen services up to the free tier of each product. This means that your maps may no longer function.

Any pending charges accrued before you deactivated Mapzen Flex will still be billed to the credit card saved in your account. However, no further charges can occur until you reactivate billing.

Anytime you want to start billing again, set your Mapzen Flex status to active.

## Subscribe to premium support services

Premium support, which includes faster response times and a service-level agreement, is available for an additional, flat monthly fee. When contacting Mapzen, users with premium support receive priority replies, usually within one business day. A service-level agreement indicates the service's required uptime and instructions to take if these are not met. (???? learn more link)

You are billed for the premium support subscription at the beginning of each month. You have access to premium support as soon as you enable it on your account, and there are no prorated costs for joining in the middle of a billing cycle.

If you cancel, you can continue to use your premium support benefits through the end of the month and your credit card will not be charged in subsequent months. No refunds are issued for the remainder of the billing period in which you cancel.

You can subscribe to premium support even if you are within the free rate limits of Mapzen’s products.
